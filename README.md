## Checkboxes in the house

Bootleg.css takes 8 of the Bootstrap JavaScript components and rekajiggers them to (ab)use the CSS `:checked` pseudo-class. Making them completely JavaScript free and only uses CSS for the interaction.

## Why did you do this?

I did it for a talk to show how crazy you can get with the `:checked` pseudo-class. Seriously don't use this or do but don't complain.
